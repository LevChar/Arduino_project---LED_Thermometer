# Arduino_project_LED_Thermometer
My second project with Arduino board - LED Thermometer 

[Link to video demonstration:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-bbTVerBQfFeeH7C4hwTjhpVMvTNdVg/view?usp=sharing)

## **Purpose:**
This program collects the current environmental temperature and writes it on a 8x8 LED display. 
The update rate is 0.5 seconds.

## **To run the program:**
Upload the code to the Arduino board, using Arduino IDE, and enjoy the show! :)

## **Compatibility:**
Program was compiled and tested in Arduino uno environment.
